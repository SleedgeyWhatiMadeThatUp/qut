## Installation

The easiest way to install it is to copy and paste the CSS (/qut-betterdiscord-theme.css) to BetterDiscord's custom CSS (found in the settings). Otherwise, just put the CSS in the themes folder and change the theme from settings.

You can get BetterDiscord at https://betterdiscord.net
